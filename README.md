# Telecom-GenAI-ML-PoC---Diffusion-Models-for-Error-Correction-in-Communications
This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how diffusion models can reverse channel corruption for error correction in digital communications. The implementation uses a denoising neural network to reverse the diffusion process and recover corrupted signals.
